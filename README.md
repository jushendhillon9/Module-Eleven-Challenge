Description: In this module challenge, I was tasked with creating three GET routes and one POST route to have the backend of a note taker app function. The note taker app, which is being hosted by Heroku, allows the user to write and store notes that they can look back upon whenever they want to on their local device. This was made possible using express to create the necessary routes to save the data to a file that holds the notes. The challenge utilizes express, including its middleware, and insomnia to test that the GET and POST routes are working.
